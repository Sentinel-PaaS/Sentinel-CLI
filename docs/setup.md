# Welcome to Sentinel 
Before you start ensure that you have an AWS account and your user has the correct IAM policy 
attached for provisioning infrastructure. Sentinel will pull your AWS credentials via a shared configuration
and credentials file. 
More info [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#shared-configuration-and-credentials-files) and [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)
